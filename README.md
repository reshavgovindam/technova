 Technovaaa Project
Your First DevOps Pipeline Project
A simple end-to-end CI/CD project using Jenkins, GitHub, Docker, Trivy Security Scanning, AWS EC2, and Terraform.

🚀 Project Overview
Technovaaa is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to:

Deploy an app on an EC2 instance

Use Jenkins for CI/CD

Build and scan Docker images

Automate infrastructure with Terraform

Perform a Trivy security scan before deployment

🧰 Tech Stack
Tool	Purpose
GitHub	Source code repository
Jenkins	CI/CD pipeline
Docker	Containerization
Trivy	Image security scanning
Terraform	Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
AWS EC2	Virtual server for deployment

🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/technovaaa.git
cd technovaaa
2. Launch EC2 with Terraform
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform apply
Make note of the public IP output.

3. Configure Jenkins on EC2
Install Jenkins and set up:

GitHub integration

Docker and Trivy installed

Jenkins credentials for GitHub and AWS

4. Trigger the Jenkins Pipeline
Make a Git push to trigger the Jenkins pipeline that will:

Clone repo

Build Docker image

Run Trivy scan

Deploy to EC2 (optionally)

🔒 Security Scanning
Trivy is used to scan the Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --no-progress -f table -o trivy-report.txt technovaaa
The pipeline continues even if vulnerabilities are found (for dev purposes).
